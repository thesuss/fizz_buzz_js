## Fizz Buzz Challenge


1. What are the similarities/differences between the Ruby and js versions?
 - Js seems to require even less code, albeit in some ways slightly more complicated code.
2. How do you find unit testing with Jasmine in comparison to RSpec?
 - I think it is pretty much the same?
3. How can you "gamify" Fizz Buzz? Consider the User Interface/Experience. Can the game be played by multiple players? What about mobile devices?
 - It is mobile friendly already. But it could be an app like with math questions, and it asks you "What is XX?" and if you get the answer wrong you have to drink. Drinking game. Ambers idea, collab on this one.
